# scRNAseq_NailMatrix

Single cell RNAseq of human nail unit defines RSPO4 onychofibroblasts and SPINK6 nail epithelium
This repository contains scripts for data processing, analysis and figure generation using scRNA-Seq for our preprint:


	Here, we studied transcriptome profiles of human nail units from polydactly samples. Single cell RNAseq with 11,541 cells from 4 extra digits revealed nail-specific mesenchymal and epithelial cell populations
