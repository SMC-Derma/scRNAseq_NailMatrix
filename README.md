# scRNAseq_NailMatrix

Single cell RNAseq of human nail unit defines RSPO4 onychofibroblasts and SPINK6 nail epithelium
This repository contains scripts for data processing, analysis and figure generation using scRNA-Seq for our preprint:


	Here, we studied transcriptome profiles of human nail units from polydactly samples. Single cell RNAseq with 11,541 cells from 4 extra digits revealed nail-specific mesenchymal and epithelial cell populations
  
  Processed data can be accessed from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database (accession code GSE158970). 
   
Version information:  
The single-cell data collection pipeline was established using CellRanger (v3.1.0). 
FASTQ reads were mapped to GRCh38.
Single-cell RNA-seq: Seurat package version 3.1.1 in R version 3.6.0 software.
Ligand-receptor interaction analysis was done with NicheNet ver.1.0
